- Add logic for loans
	- On loan creation, create all loan installments
		- Sproc for creating installments:
			- Total to pay = principal + interest (2%) * term_months
			- Per installment = total / term_months
			- Installment due dates are in one-month increments from initial date
	- Loan installments have an original price, and then a due price (increased by fines)
	- Loan installments have a date_due and date_paid - must be paid in full to set date_paid
	- Loan is considered paid when all installments are paid
	- You can't create a loan installment -> only edit to add date paid

- Do a thorough test
