X Add principal_paid, interest_paid, fines_paid to loan details (X SQL, X C#, X JS)
X improve calculate_sacco_loan_amount_paid

To do:
X Fix loan not loading on payment edit
X Remove bracket from shares value on member details
X Add comma to loan amount in describeLoan
X Add add payment option on member details page
X Remove view all installments from loan details
X Savings:
	X Don't round distributions
	X Show value of shares on member details page (in parentheses)
	X Add value of shares to shares column on member home page, and savings
	X Add commas to total distribution value on home page

~ Loans:
	~ For a payment, determine how much was principal and how much interest.
	~ Add expiry date (date of last payment)
	~ Change % paid to % of balance paid
	~ Check fine % schedule - off by 2 days
	~ Add interest per month to loan details page
	~ Make payments separate from installments
		We want to see:
		- Balance left for a loan (calculate_sacco_loan_balance(loanId, date))
			To get that, we must know:
				- Total due: calculate_sacco_loan_total_due(loanId, date): sum of:
					- Principal
					- Interest
						- Declare months_of_interest
						- First get Principal paid (calculate_sacco_loan_principal_paid(loanId, date)) - sum of principal payments up to that date
						- If principal paid < loan principal, months_of_interest = term_months
						- Else, calculate final payment date (sproc)
							- If final payment date > expiry date, then months_of_interest = term_months
							- Else, months_of_interest = installment_number of first installment with a due date on or after final payment date
						- Interest = monthly_interest * months_of_interest
					- Fines (sum of fines from payment_details view)
				- Total paid (calculate_sacco_loan_total_paid(loanId, date)) - sum of payments up to that date
				- Balance = Total due - total paid
					
	~ any amount left unpaid on an installment is considered in arrears - that much is fined
	~ interest for months after fully paid is not charged
	~ Show remaining balance on loan details page, loan home page
	~ Add payments to C#, remove installment editing
	~ Show installment schedule on loan details page

To release:
	X Remove installment sorting from js, show datePaid on paid installments
	X Remove space between ellipsis and and in "and 123 more"
