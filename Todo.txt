To do:
- Savings:
	- Enable churches as members:
		- Boolean field
		- Don't give them dividends or interest
		- Sort by isChurch
	- Don't round distributions
	- Show value of shares on member details page (in parentheses)
	- Add value of shares to shares column on member home page, and savings
	- Add commas to total distribution value on home page

- Loans:
	- Add expiry date (date of last payment)
	- Change % paid to % of balance paid
	- Check fine % schedule - off by 2 days
	- Make payments separate from installments
		- any amount left unpaid on an installment is considered in arrears - that much is fined
		- interest for months after fully paid is not charged
	- Show remaining balance on loan details page, loan home page
	- Add interest per month to loan details page
